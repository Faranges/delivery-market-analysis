# 🍽️  Delivery Market Analysis (SQL & Data Analysis)

## 📋 Project Overview

A business‑oriented data analysis project exploring food delivery market trends, customer preferences, and restaurant performance using SQL and data visualization tools.

## 📊 The Mission

Analyze delivery data to uncover actionable insights for:
* Restaurant partners (pricing, positioning, quality/ops opportunities)
* Consumers (discovery of “best value”, hidden gems, and coverage gaps)
* Platforms Takeaway & Deliveroo(where to win market share tomorrow)

## 🧠 Learning Objectives

* Understand and query SQL database structures
* Optimize SQL queries for performance
* Visualize data insights using Python or PowerBI
* Deliver impactful presentations with data-driven narratives


## 🗄️ Data Structure

This project uses two SQLite databases provided by the course:
- takeaway.db
- deliveroo.db

These files are not included in the repository for size and licensing reasons.
All SQL queries and analysis logic are available in the notebooks.


## 🔍 Key Business Questions:

1. Price Distribution: what is the price distribution of menu items?
2. Restaurant Locations: what is the distribution of restaurants per location?
3. Top Pizza Restaurants: which are the top 10 pizza restaurants by rating?
4. Dish Mapping: map locations offering kapsalons (or your favorite dish) and their average price.

5. Value Analysis: Which restaurants have the best price-to-rating ratio?
6. Coverage Gaps: Where are the delivery 'dead zones'—areas with minimal restaurant coverage?
7. Dietary Options: How does the availability of vegetarian and vegan dishes vary by area?
8. Hummus Rankings: Identify the World Hummus Order (WHO); top 3 hummus serving restaurants.
